Most of the following discussion has also been included in the comments
TASK 1:
 LEVEL 1:
  I tested all features against various other variables to check their correlation with each other. I found out that feature 1 and feature 2 were very similar except for one difference in the gender graphs- 
  females had near-normal distribution while for males, the distribution was slightly right skewed. I claimed feature 1 to be performance in an indoor sport as in case of outdoor sports, there would be 
  discrepancies in the gender distribution which i assumed not to be. Moreover, I chose a game which didn't require much intellectual capability as there was no clear correlation between grades and Feature 1. For 
  feature 2, most of the logic was same as in Feature 1 except that this time, Feature 2 had to be something that was a bit right-skewed for males. Here, I assumed that a good discipline index would be something 
  that high school boys would lack as compared to high school girls, hence I chose feature 2 to be that. For Feature 3, the distribution was right skewed for almost all the graphs. This hinted towards something 
  like income- a famous example of right-skewed distributions. This led to the conclusion of feature 3 being family's income.

  LEVEL 2:
   I chose mode to fill the missing data as it seemed most appropriate for discrete data set.

  LEVEL 3:
   Questions were easy to come up with as there were a lot of fields so we had a lot of options to make questions. Most of them were obvious like school and grades. I didn't include questions regarding romantics 
   as i had included them in Level 4, but those can be considered as a part of level 3 as well. I used bar charts throughout as they are really helpful when analyzing discerete data with limited outcomes. They 
   give a great picture of ratios and are also easy to work with.

  LEVEL 4:
   I used decision tree for this one and in order to attain a high accuracy i kept on changing the max_depth and min_samples_leaf until I got maximum accuracy.

  LEVEL 5:
   I couldn't do much here but I was able to make plot using two features I thought were meaningful- sex and Parental cohabitation status

 TASK 2:
   I could only make the model and a graph to visualize it. I couldn't add any additional functions to the model
